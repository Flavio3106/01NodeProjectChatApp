# About the project
This is a project made to gain confidence with the different frameworks and libraries widely used on the web. Feel free to edit this code or to suggest changes. 
I created a scss file to modify some bootstrap classes I needed to customize, I am not really sure this was the proper way to do this, but... as long as it works :).
